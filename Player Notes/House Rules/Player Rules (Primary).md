### Player agreed rules

### No secret class

Players tell each others what class and race they are, feel free to role play your characters secret, but inform others.

### Rule of cool

Do what you want as long as the core rule stays the same, example: The grimoire can be used as a tattoo or an engraving into the body, does not need to be strictly a book

### Rolling your character

Do it or dont, i dont mind either way, just make a character that you want to play for our short(ish) campaign

### Critical Rolls

Keeps like in the book

### Time Limit

Give me a default value if your turn takes **more than 5 minutes**, if it takes more you do your default value
