### Early Years and History

Founded nearly a thousand years ago, the once mighty empire of Chinon barely hold onto its titles. A fractured noble federation, encroaching religious pressure and a large working class with nearly 0 rights, it has been purported since records began that the empire would fracture, split, decay. Yet here it stands, defiant in its hatred for all ["knife ears"](obsidian://open?vault=Aulien&file=Regions%2FThe%20Ailing%20Isles%20(Far%20North%20East)%2FThe%20Elven%20Remenants%2FOverview), the people living here would sooner court the dark gods than give up their ability to enact supposed "vengeance" against the mainland elves.

The island nation was created before the great floods, the spine still stood as a bastion of dwarven engineering at the dawn of its creation. The waters swallowed up most of the good, arable land and left only the outer wilds. The nation started out under warrior kings, this trend continues to this day, though diplomacy is the preferred vehicle of the ruling class, a careful balance is often tested to keep all parties involved pointed at their main enemy.

### Culture

A strong culture of "Revanchism" still exists in Chinon to this day, the desire to enact revenge upon perceived enemies (namely, [elves](obsidian://open?vault=Aulien&file=Regions%2FThe%20Ailing%20Isles%20(Far%20North%20East)%2FThe%20Elven%20Remenants%2FOverview)). Though it should be noted that their focus is mostly on the elven institutions as opposed to the individual. Many residents are discriminatory to any races considered friendly with elves, with most being uneducated and therefore generally xenophobic.

As a nation, class is the bread and butter of any conversation pertaining to daily life, a knight may take a peasant as squire one day, and ram his sword through the remaining family the next, with no cultural or legal repercussions due to their class difference. Those without noble blood should soon seek the endorsement of a royal family, or the diplomatic protection of a foreign power, this has lead to a kind of middle man culture for pirates, mercenaries and vagabonds, with each paying taxes to a local family to continue operating in Chinon. 

## A Culture unto itself

Chinon is, for the most part, unlike any other part of the world. The cultural and religious beliefs of the locals mean that the nobility is seen not as superiors or as near-gods or even gods. Rather, it is understood that the "ruling class" of noble lords and ladies are a force of nature, those that can enact any toll or punishment on the others as they please (Note> As a man of the Forceful Rivers, this mindset perplexes me, simple resistance would dislodge such horrible cultural practices ... but alas).

It can be seen daily that the rank and file truly believe this, women ignore their loved ones being trampled by the lords poachermen, men will rarely lift a finger if their wife or daughter is having an evil inflicted upon them, the answer comes back like some kind of great joke; It is ok if a noble does it ... (Post Scriptum>
To any travelers going to Chinon, get a local sponsor or better yet avoid the nobles that roam, rape and ravage the citizenry)

### Current situation

With the elves becoming more and more insignificant, important persons in Chinon are turning inwards to search for problems. The clergy has been pushing a more theocratic overview for the nation, with support and opposition from all sides, the peasantry has petitioned for more rights but often fails to secure even the most basic boons which slaves of other nations could have boasted about since decades. 

The nobility is the most volatile of the bunch, with push back against both the clergy and the peasantry being likely but causing an odd paradox of inaction, whichever royal house moves first will be opening itself up for attack, and therefore stands to lose the most in this action .

### Geography

The island has one positive, it can boast of few monsters compared to the mainland, though these creatures are often twisted, mutated version of their land based counterparts. The islands host large forests, pleasant fields, swamps and the standard array between these three, with a cold winter and a temperate summer. Visibility is often low on the islands, especially during spring, and unlike the mainland counterparts, air travel (gryphion) is rare due to the slow mutating effects of local feed.
