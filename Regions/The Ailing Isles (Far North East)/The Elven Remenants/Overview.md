### Early years and history

The early years of the elven dominion is largely unknown to outsiders, even in the remnants of the empire this information is protected and secret. The eastern remnant is considered irrelevant on the world stage, scholars question if this is fact or merely a work of fiction. 

What information we do know is often repeated, elves being one of the first races spread out to each corner of the globe, created dominion over the lands with control swapping hands between differing factions until the advent of humanity. Often considered a veiled threat or a dying breed, most political actors are unsure what to do with them. 

### Culture

Elven holdings have a certain focus on perfecting their given craft, with a large focus on magic use and the perfection of arts relating to such magics. Outside of this, they are known to be isolationist in nature, and seemingly have no concerted aims towards expansion. An often overlooked intricacy of their culture is their racism towards other elves, those that reject the dominion are largely considered "lost" and "unnatural" by those of the righteous path.

### Geography

Situated in expertly build citadels and sprawling cities, the elven dominion often gives the illusion of an industrialized, urban nation with the capacity to host armies numbering in the millions. Mostly these cities are up kept for foreign power projection and are in reality ghost towns, with the actual diaspora being spread across the eastern continent, due to the size of their "claimed land" the geography can range from windswept mountains of the tundra, to blistering desert oases.
