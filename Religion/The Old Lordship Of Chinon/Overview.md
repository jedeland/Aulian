### Ancient Spirits

#### The Lords and Ladies of the Mire

Not much is known of the older organized religion of the Chinon isles, the general consensus is that in older times, human emotions took on the form of demi-gods or more commonly referred to as "local-supernaturals". Over time, a few stand out gods have become more popular, and the religions surrounding them more formalized.

- The Sisterhood
	- A collection of deities, often represented as a pile of women, striken with red tattoos of differing shapes. Often times this goddess('s') deals with the harshness of day to day life, and acts as a general idea of a mothers love which shields followers from the turmoil
- The Rightous Two
	- To talk of Chinons political structure is to start a full thesis consisting of many pages. The righteous two or, "The Two" as they are known, represent a lord and lady, morphed and formed by the horrid feudal structure created by the local nobility, the lord and lady often ride on horse back, armour clad and hunting whomever they seem fit. (Such is the way in Chinon)
- The Western Specter
	- Those that have broken the "Spell of the Two", that do not accept the current order of strict hierarchy often pray to the Western Specter, he is characterized as a skeleton sailor, often his aspects will appear on the shores, one foot on land the other still in the sea, with illicit goods and sometimes gifts for the younger, downtrodden masses. 
	- Though sightings are rare, the skeletal boatsman is a common myth in Chinon, on the one hand, he represents the underclass that seeks to rebel and change the status quo, and on the other, scholars hypothesize he represents the human empathy felt by people repressing their emotions
