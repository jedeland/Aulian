### The First Servants of Man

### Igfe

Goddess of fire and anarchy, followers of igfe believe that egalitarianism is a core function of existence, all things, people and ideas should be allowed to exist so long as they do not interfere with the 'goodness' of the whole. 
Idealists to the core, many sub doctrines of Igfe believers have appeared in the most recent era, some with less accepting views, but still miles ahead of other religious cadres. Worshipers are easily recognizable, often representing their god through fire and sacrifice, in more recent times worship has increased due to the actions of a modern adventuring group in the western reaches.

### Vauxher 

The opposite of Igfe, the lord of sea, sail and sky, is a god of orderly actions. Transport and trade are his main domains, with his blessings often known to the cross ocean traders that brave the open waters, Vauxher is often seen as cold and distant from his followers, simply warning of weather and tide is blessing enough.
The southern lands often worship older gods, but Vauxher is a favorite in D'nain, the Gryphon riders sing his praise where they can, and it is said that the nejriffs are a gift given during the sundering. The Occ nobility often remains silent on religious affairs, but Vauxher seems to be a gold standard for worship and official religious ceremonies.

### Baehrest | Beliuren

"The Black", as he was known during the sundering, Baehrest has often been considered the god of the desperate. His main domain was that of development, though scholars still argue about this background, more often than naught; due to the actions taken during the "Hymn for the Hidden", he has become known as a god of reavers, raiders and similar undesirables. 

The official stance by the Occ church has been to reestablish his presence as a god of the martially inclined, with a focus on perfecting warfare and attaining a level of respect and legacy through warfare. Time will only tell if this has come to pass

### Etoil 
Judgement is not a black and white phenomenon in the Occ lands, Etoil is and has always been known as the "magistrates" god, a judge that is not interested in binary rulings, but rather on enforcing a code of conduct for the good of the community. Often touted as the "True" god in the core territories, Etoil is a grandfatherly figure, with wisdom and experience that is used to bring about the most humane decisions in the enactment of laws (Authors note: or contracts, written or implied!)

### Others

- The hatchling: Found inside of border territories with Sterngeisel, little is known about the hatchling, only that the xenophobia of the residents makes research difficult
- Gromash: Orcish minor god, found mostly in territories with liberated slave enclaves
- Dabruen (The Gluttoned Oak): Demon, Devil, Minor God or Powerful Creature? It is unclear what form and role Dabruen takes in reality, most of his followers worship him for resilience, he is often touted as a beacon of stability (whatever that means).
- Pives (The martyr): A rare god, the first martyr in the sundering was historically the Duke of the Occ lands who refused to return his bride to the Elven kings, his death and subsequent legend (along with his brothers tale) has, in the eyes of some, diefied him.
